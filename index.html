                <h1>Floods, Rainfall and Losses Across Malaysia</h1>
                <p>Floods are one of Malaysia’s most frequent natural hazards, 
                    often linked to seasonal rainfall patterns. This dashboard provides 
                    an overview of flood occurrences across Malaysian states from 2000 
                    to 2024. The map displays relative flood frequency per state, 
                    normalized against the state with the highest flood count. Click 
                    on a state to explore its monthly rainfall for the 
                    selected year, helping you understand how rainfall patterns relate to 
                    flood events.

                <h2>Rainfall Variability</h2>
                <p>Malaysia’s rainfall patterns vary widely across regions due to differing exposure to the Northeast Monsoon.
                    The box plot visualizes the distribution of daily rainfall (mm) across states, highlighting how 
                    <strong>Monsoon-Affected</strong> regions generally experience <strong>higher rainfall medians</strong> and 
                    <strong>wider variability</strong> compared to less affected states. The <strong>broader interquartile ranges</strong> 
                    for eastern coastal states suggest <strong>greater day-to-day rainfall fluctuations</strong>, aligning with seasonal monsoon impacts.

                <p>This grouped stacked bar chart compares the <b>flood emergency</b> and <b>conservation losses</b> 
                    across Malaysian states in <b>2022 and 2023</b>.
                </p>
                <p>From the chart, it is clear that <b>overall losses decreased significantly from 2022 to 2023</b> 
                    in most states. For example, <b>Selangor</b> recorded a sharp drop from over <b>RM69,000</b> 
                    in total losses in 2022 to only about <b>RM7,957</b> in 2023. Similarly, states like <b>Kelantan</b>,
                    <b>Sabah</b>, and <b>Pahang</b> also saw noticeable declines, suggesting improved flood control 
                    measures or fewer severe flood events in 2023.
                </p>
                <p>However, not all states followed this trend. <b>Perak</b> experienced a notable <b>increase 
                    in total loss</b>, rising from around <b>RM18,199</b> in 2022 to <b>RM26,358</b> in 2023, 
                    mainly driven by higher emergency losses. This could indicate localised flood incidents or 
                    new vulnerabilities emerging in 2023.
                </p>

                    <p>In terms of loss composition, most states in 2022 had <b>higher conservation losses</b> 
                        compared to emergency losses, meaning more resources were allocated to recovery and 
                        preventive measures. In 2023, this balance shifted towards <b>emergency losses</b> 
                        in several states, suggesting that while overall damage was reduced, <b>immediate 
                        response costs remained relatively high</b> in certain regions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, the chart highlights an encouraging pattern, <b>nationwide flood impacts are 
                        declining</b>, but continued attention is needed in states to sustain this improvement. 
                        The data also emphasises the importance of maintaining effective flood conservation 
                        programs even during years of lower flood activity.
